# Solana AI Agent — Vera

Vera is a Solana AI Agent built for fast, friendly on‑chain actions.
It combines an AI chat experience with a secure execution layer to make
Solana operations simple and accessible for everyone.

This repository represents the full project experience: a production‑ready
AI chat interface paired with a secure Solana execution backend.

---

## Product Vision

Vera removes friction from Web3.
It replaces complex steps with a friendly, guided AI conversation.
The goal is to make Solana operations feel as easy as a regular app.

---

## What It Does

- **Token transfers** on Solana
- **Token swaps** on Solana
- **Token creation** on Solana
- **NFT collection & minting** on Solana

All actions are guided by AI chat and executed automatically through the app.
Users do not need to manually sign or confirm every step.

---

## AI‑First Experience

Vera is not just a chatbot—it is an execution layer.
Users interact naturally and the system handles the entire flow.

Key outcomes:

- Clear, friendly guidance
- Minimal friction at every step
- Human‑style confirmations
- Automatic execution where possible

---

## NFT Minting Experience

NFT minting is fully supported and designed for real production use:

1. **Create a collection**
   - Upload collection image
   - Name, symbol, and description
   - Collection is minted and verified

2. **Mint NFTs in the collection**
   - Upload NFT image
   - Name and description
   - Add attributes (trait_type / value)
   - Optional quantity for batch minting

Results are displayed in friendly AI‑style messages, not raw logs.
